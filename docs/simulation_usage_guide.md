results = []

for capacity in capacities:
    config = base_config.copy()
    config['monthly_training_capacity'] = capacity

3. **Sensitivity Testing**: Ensure reasonable parameter responses
4. **Cross-Validation**: Compare with similar international programs

## Limitations and Considerations

### Model Limitations
- **Simplified Interactions**: Real-world complexity is reduced
- **Static Assumptions**: Some parameters don't change over time
- **Limited External Factors**: Global economic changes not fully modeled
- **Cultural Nuances**: Simplified representation of cultural factors

### Data Limitations
- **Estimation Required**: Some data points are estimated
- **Update Frequency**: Data may become outdated
- **Regional Variations**: Limited granular regional data
- **Informal Sector**: Difficult to capture informal employment fully

### Usage Recommendations
1. **Comparative Analysis**: Use for comparing scenarios, not absolute predictions
2. **Trend Identification**: Focus on trends and relative improvements
3. **Policy Testing**: Test policy impacts before implementation
4. **Regular Updates**: Update data and parameters regularly
5. **Expert Consultation**: Combine with expert judgment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Errors**
   - Reduce number of agents
   - Use smaller time steps
   - Run scenarios separately

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Reduce simulation duration
   - Decrease agent population
   - Use parallel processing

3. **Unrealistic Results**
   - Check parameter values
   - Validate data inputs
   - Review scenario assumptions

### Performance Optimization

```python
# For large-scale simulations
config = {
    'simulation_months': 24,        # Shorter duration
    'num_youth_agents': 5000,       # Fewer agents
    'batch_processing': True,       # Enable batching
    'parallel_jobs': 4              # Use multiple cores
}
```
